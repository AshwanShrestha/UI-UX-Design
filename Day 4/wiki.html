            Before the unification of Nepal, the Kathmandu Valley was known as
            Nepal.[c] The precise origin of the term Nepāl is uncertain. Nepal
            appears in ancient Indian literary texts dated as far back as the
            fourth century AD.[16] An absolute chronology can not be
            established, as even the oldest texts may contain anonymous
            contributions dating as late as the early modern period. Academic
            attempts to provide a plausible theory are hindered by the lack of a
            complete picture of history and insufficient understanding of
            linguistics or relevant Indo-European and Tibeto-Burman
            languages.[17] The name "Nepal" is first recorded in texts from the
            Vedic period of the Indian subcontinent, the era in ancient Nepal
            when Hinduism was founded, the predominant religion of the country.
            In the middle of the first millennium BC, Gautama Buddha, the
            founder of Buddhism, was born in Lumbini in southern Nepal. Parts of
            northern Nepal were intertwined with the culture of Tibet. The
            centrally located Kathmandu Valley is intertwined with the culture
            of Indo-Aryans, and was the seat of the prosperous Newar confederacy
            known as Nepal Mandala. The Himalayan branch of the ancient Silk
            Road was dominated by the valley's traders. The cosmopolitan region
            developed distinct traditional art and architecture. By the 18th
            century, the Gorkha Kingdom achieved the unification of Nepal. The
            Shah dynasty established the Kingdom of Nepal and later formed an
            alliance with the British Empire, under its Rana dynasty of
            premiers. The country was never colonised but served as a buffer
            state between Imperial China and British India. Parliamentary
            democracy was introduced in 1951 but was twice suspended by Nepalese
            monarchs, in 1960 and 2005. The Nepalese Civil War in the 1990s and
            early 2000s resulted in the establishment of a secular republic in
            2008, ending the world's last Hindu monarchy.
